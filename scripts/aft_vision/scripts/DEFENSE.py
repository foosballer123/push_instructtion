# given that when the rod is moved entirely across the field each player 'runs' across their respective zone, the zone each player covers is approximately 550 steps across
# however, not every zone is equal in size and this must be accounted for in the final calculations
# for now, the steps can be calculated based on the ration of the number of pixels to the size of the zone

# it might be possible to set each players zone to a unique range of pixels and to find the number of steps it takes for that specific player to cross its zone
# then you could relate each players position to a fractional distance across their zone and therby a number of motor steps

# example
# player two's zone might not start from a flush position against the wall (due to the uneven positions of the players)
# player twos zone could exist within a range of pixels/steps
# player two could have calculations that only get called when the ball is detected within its pixel range
# when player two is set to GAURD it could automatically fluctauate between a number of motor steps

# each players GUARDING RANGE could be associated with a range of MOTOR STEPS that could relate to pixel values.

# THIS PROGRAM "AS IS" IS A ROUGH APPROXIMATION OF THE FINAL CALCULATIONS. THE GUARDING RANGE OF EACH PLAYER AND THE ASSOCIATED NUMBER OF MOTOR STEPS MUST BE FINE TUNED
